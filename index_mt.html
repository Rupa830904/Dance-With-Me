                    <p>
                        For anyone that doesn't know me already, let me tell you a bit about myself and why I created
                        this website.
                        I have been interested in riding motorcyles since I was old enough to get on the back of my dads
                        Honda 70
                        but didn't chase my dream of owning my own bike until 2005.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first bike I owned was a 2002 Yamaha Virago 125 cruiser which I traded a month later for a
                        1991 Virago 400.
                        6 months later I bought a 1989 CBR 250rr. I rode both these bikes all around Ireland, exploring
                        and venturing up all sorts of roads, half of which would be better suited to a trails bike.
                        Since then I have owned a wide selection of different bikes, big and small. I take pride in
                        trying to do my own maintenance and upgrades on my bikes.
                        It gives me great satisfaction riding a bike that I have made my own mark on, be that with some
                        custom paint jobs or simply adding some extras mods.
                        I love to get out and explore around the country and usually try to take the alternative routes
                        off the beaten track to see what I can find along the way.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    In recent years I have started to widen my horizons with a trip to France and a couple of trips to
                    Scotland.
                    I hope in the near future to get to explore a bit more of Europe. I have created this website for
                    myself to chronicle some of my adventures
                    and to allow anyone who is interested, to see what I get up to on my travels or maybe inspire
                    someone to join me on my travels. If you have questions about my trips or you want to join me on a
                    day trip or maybe venture further afield then fill out the Contact Form below and I will get in
                    touch.
                    I currently ride a Suzuki Vstrom 650 Adventure bike which is a great all rounder and has never let
                    me down.
                    I am a member of <a href="https://daisy-mcg.github.io/MilestoneProject-1/index.html" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">Hair O' The Dog Mcc</a> and consider the other members as part of my family. We
                    get out and about to bike events as much as we can and support local charities by running Rock Nights
                    ourselves or attending events run by other clubs.
                    I was also a volunteer rider with Bloodbikes Ireland a few years ago.
